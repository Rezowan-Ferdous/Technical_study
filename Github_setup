Step 1: Generate a new SSH key
Run the following command to generate a new SSH key pair using the ed25519 algorithm:

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

Replace "your_email@example.com" with your actual email address.

You’ll be prompted with something like this:


Enter file in which to save the key (/home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_ed25519):
Just press Enter to accept the default location.

Next, you’ll be asked to enter a passphrase (optional). If you don’t want a passphrase, just press Enter again.

Step 2: Add the SSH key to the SSH agent
After generating the key, you can add it to the SSH agent by running:

eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
Step 3: Add the SSH public key to GitHub
You’ll now need to copy the content of your public key (id_ed25519.pub) to your GitHub account.

Run the following command to display the public key:

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Copy the entire output, then:

Go to your GitHub account.
Navigate to Settings -> SSH and GPG keys.
Click New SSH key and paste the key in the field.
Give it a title and click Add SSH key.
Step 4: Test the connection
Finally, verify the connection by running:


ssh -T git@github.com
This should authenticate your SSH key with GitHub. Let me know how it goes!
